Vim is a fast, powerful text editor that can be used for programming and text editing. It probably is the most efficient text editor to edit code. One of its best features is the ability to do quick edits that can save you a lot of time. It is extremely lightweight and efficient in terms of memory consumption.

Vim has been around for a long time, and is still one of the most popular text editor today. With vim, you can do more with fewer keystrokes. You can do things like  change words, sentences or paragraphs with commands, you don't need to take your fingers of the keyboard.

These are 10 reasons to try Vim.

1. It's everywhere.  You can [download](https://www.vim.org/download.php) it on Windows, Mac and Linux/Unix. It is distributed with most UNIX systems. 

2. The core is small and well documented.  The core is about 100k lines of code in about 10k files.

3. It's fast and flexible. No bloat. It is perfect for all kinds of text editing.

4. It works with your language environment.  It can use Perl, Python, Ruby or Tcl scripting as well as C++, C, Java or any others (the core itself is only written in C). Vim is often called a "programmers editor", and so useful for programming that many consider it as a replacement for their entire IDE.

5. You can program it with keyboard macros.  It's not a big deal to learn to write macros and you don't have to use them, but they are very powerful and allow you to modify the editor in ways that would be impossible otherwise.

6. It's good for programming and for text editing. Programming is a lot of typing, so vim can make you more efficient. In fact, many programmers swear by vim (or "vi"), saying that it's the only editor they'll ever need. Vim is powerful and efficient, but also somewhat difficult to learn at first.

7. Customizability - One of the most important features of Vim is its high degree of customizability. You can change almost every aspect of the editor to match your needs and preferences.

8. Efficiency - With Vim, you can perform many common actions with just a few keystrokes. This can save you a lot of time in the long run, especially if you use Vim regularly. Vim is the most efficient text editor there is. If you're still using an old school editor like Notepad or TextEdit you should try Vim. Here's why: Vim has a steep learning curve, but your workflows will never be the same once you've mastered it.

9. Available plugins - There are literally thousands of [vim plugins](https://vim.monster/posts/vim-plugins-to-write-cleaner-code) available online, for free. This allows you to extend the functionality of Vim even further and customize it to suit your specific needs even more.

10. Active community - The Vim community is large and active, which means that there is always someone who can help you with any problems or questions that you may have.

## Why I use vim?

I was first introduced to vim while working as a software engineer. At the time, I was using a text editor called Sublime Text. While I liked Sublime Text, it didn't have all of the features that I needed for my work. So, someone suggested that I try vim.

At first, I found vim to be very difficult to use. It was hard to remember all of the different keyboard shortcuts and commands. However, once I started using it more and more, it became easier and easier. Now, I can't imagine using anything else!

There are several reasons why I prefer vim over other text editors. First of all, it is very customizable. You can install plugins to add new features or change the way vim looks and feels. Second of all, vim is very efficient. Once you learn how to use it properly, you can do things much faster than with other text editors. Finally,vim is just plain fun! There's something about being able to control everything with your keyboard that just feels cool :)
